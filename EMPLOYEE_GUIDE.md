# Employee Guide to Spradley Feedback

Welcome! This guide explains how to participate in Spradley feedback surveys and how your voice contributes to workplace improvements.

## 🎯 What is Spradley?

Spradley is an AI-powered feedback platform that lets you share your honest thoughts about work in a conversational, confidential way. Instead of rigid survey questions, you have a natural conversation with an empathetic AI that listens and adapts to what you want to share.

## 🔐 Your Privacy Matters

### Anonymization

Your survey may be:
- **Anonymous**: Your responses cannot be traced back to you. Not even HR can identify who said what.
- **Identified**: Your responses are linked to you so HR can provide targeted support.

The anonymization level is clearly stated before you begin. **You always have a choice to participate or not.**

### Data Retention

Your responses are kept for a limited time (typically 60 days) and then automatically deleted. You can see the exact retention period in the consent screen.

### Your Rights
- **Give Consent**: You explicitly agree to participate before each survey
- **View Consent History**: See all surveys you've consented to
- **Revoke Consent**: Request deletion of your data (available in your profile)
- **Privacy Transparency**: Full visibility into how your data is used

## 📝 How to Participate

### Step 1: Sign In

1. Go to the Spradley login page
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click **Sign In**

### Step 2: View Assigned Surveys

Once signed in, you'll see:
- **Active Surveys**: Surveys you can complete now
- **Completed Surveys**: Surveys you've already finished
- **Survey Updates**: Actions HR has taken based on feedback

If you have an assigned survey, you'll see a prompt to start.

### Step 3: Give Consent

Before starting, you'll see:
- **Why We're Asking**: The purpose of the survey
- **How We'll Use Your Data**: What HR will learn from your responses
- **Your Privacy Level**: Anonymous or identified
- **Data Retention**: How long responses are kept

**Important**: Read carefully. Only proceed if you're comfortable.

- Click **I Consent** to continue
- Click **Decline** to skip this survey (no penalty)

### Step 4: Set Your Initial Mood

You'll see a mood dial from 0 (very negative) to 100 (very positive).

Slide the dial to reflect how you're feeling right now about the survey topics.

**Why?** This helps us understand if the conversation improves your mood and gives you a moment to reflect.

Click **Continue** when ready.

### Step 5: Have a Conversation

Now the AI conversation begins. You'll see:
- **AI messages**: Questions or prompts based on survey themes
- **Your text input**: Type your responses naturally

#### Conversation Tips

**Be Yourself**: Write as you would speak. No need for formal language.

**Be Honest**: This is your safe space. Share what's really on your mind.

**Take Your Time**: No rush. The AI will wait for your response.

**Be Brief or Detailed**: Short answers are fine. So are longer stories. The AI adapts.

**You're in Control**: 
- You can end the conversation early by clicking **Save & Exit**
- Your progress is saved automatically
- You can resume later if needed

#### What the AI Will Ask

The conversation covers themes selected for this survey, such as:
- Work-life balance
- Team dynamics
- Career development
- Leadership effectiveness
- Resources and support

The AI will:
- Ask follow-up questions based on your responses
- Show empathy and understanding
- Adapt to your tone and engagement level
- Never judge or criticize

#### Sample Conversation Flow

**AI**: "Thank you for being here. Let's start by talking about work-life balance. How do you feel about your current balance between work and personal life?"

**You**: "Honestly, it's been tough lately. I feel like I'm always working."

**AI**: "I hear you, and I'm sorry it's been difficult. Can you share a bit more about what's making it feel overwhelming? Is it the workload, the hours, or something else?"

**You**: "Mostly the hours. I stay late almost every day and work weekends too."

**AI**: "That sounds exhausting. Do you feel supported by your manager in managing your workload, or does it feel like something you're handling on your own?"

**You**: "My manager tries, but there's just too much work for the team size."

**AI**: "Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like capacity is a real challenge. Is there anything specific that would help—like more headcount, better prioritization, or clearer deadlines?"

**You**: "Definitely more headcount. We're stretched too thin."

**AI**: "I appreciate your honesty. Let's move to another area..."

The conversation continues through other themes until you've covered the key topics.

### Step 6: Set Your Final Mood

After the conversation, you'll see the mood dial again.

Slide it to reflect how you're feeling now, after sharing your thoughts.

**Why?** This shows whether the conversation was helpful and gives HR insight into employee sentiment trends.

### Step 7: Session Complete

You'll see a confirmation:
- "Thank you! Your feedback has been recorded."
- You'll automatically be signed out after a few seconds

Your responses are now with HR, who will review them to make improvements.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Can HR see my individual responses?

**Anonymous Surveys**: No. Your responses are paraphrased and separated from your identity. HR sees themes and sentiment, not "Jane said X."

**Identified Surveys**: Yes. HR can see your responses with your name to provide support or follow up.

### What if I start a survey but can't finish?

Click **Save & Exit**. Your progress is saved. Next time you sign in, you'll be prompted to resume where you left off.

### Can I skip a survey?

Yes. Click **Decline** during the consent step. There's no penalty for declining to participate.

### What if I accidentally share something confidential?

If you realize mid-conversation, you can:
- Click **Save & Exit** immediately
- Contact HR directly to request removal of specific details

### How long does a survey take?

Typically 10-15 minutes, but it varies based on how much you want to share. There's no time limit.

### What if I have urgent concerns?

If the AI detects urgent language (e.g., safety issues, harassment, distress), it may escalate your concern to HR for immediate attention. You'll be notified if this happens.

For emergencies, **always contact HR directly** rather than relying on the survey.

### Can I change my mind after submitting?

You can revoke consent (which requests data deletion), but you cannot edit submitted responses. If you need something corrected, contact HR directly.

### Will my manager see my responses?

Only if:
1. Your manager is an HR Admin or HR Analyst with analytics access
2. The survey was **identified** (not anonymous)

For **anonymous surveys**, no one—not even your manager—can trace responses back to you.

## 🚨 When to Contact HR Directly

Use the survey for:
- General workplace feedback
- Ideas for improvement
- Sentiment about culture, balance, development

Contact HR directly (not via survey) for:
- Harassment or discrimination
- Safety concerns
- Urgent personal issues
- Specific complaints requiring investigation

## 💡 Tips for Meaningful Feedback

### Be Specific
Instead of "Things are bad," try "The project deadlines are unrealistic given our team size."

### Focus on Impact
Share how issues affect you: "The lack of feedback from my manager makes me feel unsure about my performance."

### Suggest Solutions
If comfortable: "Regular 1-on-1s would help me feel more connected and supported."

### Balance Positives and Negatives
If there are bright spots, share them too. It helps HR know what's working.
